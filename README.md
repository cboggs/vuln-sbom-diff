# SBOM Vuln diff - go build vs bazel build

This is a simple replication of the SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) issues we are facing when building using bazel

In this setup we are trying to build a simple go application with
- `UUID:1.6.0` package with checksum `h1:NIvaJDMOsjHA8n1jAhLSgzrAzy1Hgr+hNrb57e+94F0=`

Even though the package is simple, there are quiet a few differences in SBOM

I have put the diff in [here](https://www.diffchecker.com/yNT6BwEJ/)

You can checkout the SBOMs generated by Syft in
- ./sbom-bazel-build.json
- ./sbom-go-build.json

#### Process:

1. Install the scanners - [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)/[trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.18.3/installation/#homebrew)
2. Create images - 1 built with Go and 1 with bazel - Sample app and Docker images available in this repo!
3. Run the scans for the 2 images(Commands)!
  - `Syft - syft <your-docker-image> -o json`
  - `Trivy - trivy image --format cyclonedx <your-docker-image>`
4. Compare the diff [here](https://www.diffchecker.com/)
